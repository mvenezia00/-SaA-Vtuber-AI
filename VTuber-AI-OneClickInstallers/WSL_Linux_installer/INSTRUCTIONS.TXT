Thank you for downloading oobabooga/text-generation-webui (mvenezia00's fork).

# Installation
0) Install Nvidia drivers on Windows
1) Install WSL and WSL Ubuntu
in WSL do : 
	
	sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
	sudo apt install build-essential
	sudo apt install nvidia-utils-530
	sudo apt install gnome-terminal
	download OneCLickInstaller from https://github.com/mvenezia00/-SaA-Vtuber-AI/releases/tag/Release
	unpack, go in the new directory and do: sudo bash start_linux.sh
	once it's done, the script will ask you which model do you want to download. We will use TheBloke/vicuna-AlekseyKorshuk-7B-GPTQ-4bit-128g
	this will download the model you choose and will start the webui server. Go http://127.0.0.1:7860/ to use the webui.
	If you want to start the webui again, just redo: sudo bash start_linux.sh


# Updating

Run the "update" script. This will only install the updates, so it should
be much faster than the initial installation.

May need to delete the 'text-generation-webui\repositories\GPTQ-for-LLaMa'
folder if GPTQ-for-LLaMa needs to be updated.

# Adding flags like --chat, --notebook, etc

Edit the "webui.py" script using a text editor and add the desired flags
to the line that says

run_cmd("python server.py --chat --model-menu")

For instance, to add the --notebook flag, change it to

run_cmd("python server.py --notebook --model-menu")

# Running an interactive shell

In order to run an interactive shell in the miniconda environment, run
the "cmd" script. This is useful for installing additional requirements
manually.
